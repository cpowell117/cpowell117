🚀 Hi, I'm Christopher Powell! I'm currently completing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a minor in Communication at Florida State University, where I've maintained a solid GPA of 3.003. My academic journey began at Miami Dade Community College, where I earned an Associate's degree in Liberal Arts.

👨‍💻 My academic coursework has been a diverse blend, covering topics from Introduction to Programming and Data Structures to the Theory & Structure of Databases and Artificial Intelligence. I'm particularly intrigued by the complexities of Operating Systems and the innovative realms of Mobile Programming and Deep, Reinforcement Learning.

🛠️ In terms of technical prowess, I'm skilled in a variety of languages, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, C/C++, Java, and TypeScript. I'm adept with frameworks like React, Express, Node.js, and Fast API, and familiar with developer tools such as AWS, Azure, Docker, Git, and GitHub. My soft skills, such as adaptability, collaboration, and resilience, complement my technical abilities, enabling me to excel in fast-paced environments.

🌟 I've channelled my skills into impactful projects, like a comprehensive data analytics application developed with a team at FSU using the MERN stack, integrating machine learning and deep learning models. Another notable project is a real-time chat application I developed, showcasing my skills in Node, Express, and WebSocket technology. Additionally, I've crafted a responsive portfolio website, demonstrating my flair for user-centric design and meticulous version control.

📢 As the President of the Online Association for Computing Machinery at FSU, I've honed my leadership skills, promoting collaboration and innovation among my peers.

I'm excited to bring this combination of academic knowledge, technical skill, and leadership experience to the professional world, where I aim to create innovative solutions and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
